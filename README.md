eRegister2
==========

This is an electronic attendance register

This project is an assignment portfolio for my SHU Web Architexture module where I've been trying to build a web based eletronic register. I will be looking at different aspects of MVC Application developments and web servers.

Also using the git and grails tools, then creating a eletronic attendance register.

This assignment has helped me widen my knowledge as well, even though it isn't fully complete it has allowed me to understand the processes that need to be made. Also giving me an idea on how things work behind the scene and seeing some of this assignment coming together as been one of the best things of this assignment.

- Running this project
Opening up your vmware

-Notes - Make sure the database it created with the uft8 charset, this is also a grails/groovy application
